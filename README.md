# corona

Script to visualize the current pandemic situation in Belgium.

Based on the visualization provided by [sciensano](https://covid-19.sciensano.be/sites/default/files/Covid19/Meest%20recente%20update.pdf) with a few improvements:
* Logarithmic scale: visualizes trends more clearly for a virus that behaves exponentially
* Customizable date range
* Option to visualize situation in specific province only

The images below show an example of the visualization of the script and sciensano on the same day (30/12/2021):
